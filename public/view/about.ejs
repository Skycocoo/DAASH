        <h5>Storms and floods and wild-fires, oh my! </h5>
        <h5>Need help with recovery solutions after a calamity? Need a plan before the event even happens? You're in the right place!</h5>
        <p>The recent increase in natural disasters such as the fires in California and tropical storms around the world has caused damage that have cost a lot to many families; for some, even their lives.

        <h3> Project Description </h3>
        <p>
            DAASH is a web app that provides useful disaster information in a user-friendly way. It pulls disaster data from FEMA and overlays it with news to give the user helpful insights into disasters happening around them. <br>

            Written using Node.js for the backend, APIs from FEMA, NewsAPI, and PredictHQ, and a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to craft the frontend, DAASH helps you find the current disasters occurring in different parts of the world and understand your home using reliable data. </p>
